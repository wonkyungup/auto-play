Automatically play YouTube Shorts videos via switch.

You need to open the YouTube Shorts homepage to use it.
A switch is created at the top inside the video.
If there is no switch, it will refresh the page.

It is a test project made for personal study, so I would appreciate it if you could understand it even if you fix it late.
The code has been posted on Github.

If you have any additional or uncomfortable points while using it, please send us a review or e-mail and we will respond.

[Version 1.0.0]
1. UI has been changed overall.
2. Fixed the problem that the video stops after several hours.
