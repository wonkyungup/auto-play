<h1>Auto Youtube Shorts Scroll Down</h1>
<p>This extension adds a button to automatically skip YouTube Shorts videos.</p>

A switch is created at the top inside the video.
If there is no switch, it will refresh the page.

It is a test project made for personal study, so I would appreciate it if you could understand it even if you fix it late.
The code has been posted on Github.
