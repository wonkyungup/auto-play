Automatically play YouTube Shorts videos through a switch.

You need to open the YouTube Shorts homepage to use it.
A switch is created at the top inside the video.
If there is no switch, it will refresh the page.

This is a test project made for personal study, so please give us a lot of interest.
The code has been posted on Github.

Update (v0.0.3): Added popup window, changed default UI.
