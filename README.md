<h1>Auto Youtube Shorts Scroll Down</h1>
<p>This extension adds a button to automatically skip YouTube Shorts videos.</p>

A switch is created at the top inside the video.
If there is no switch, it will refresh the page.

It is a test project made for personal study, so I would appreciate it if you could understand it even if you fix it late.
The code has been posted on Github.

If you have any additional or uncomfortable points while using it, please send us a review or e-mail and we will respond.

### Version 1.0.3
- FIX: Remove previously blocked scroll event
    - When scrolling, too many events were imported and throttling was used, but there were still too many events, so the events were removed. However, there was a problem here, and the problem that the video did not automatically go over was confirmed and removed altogether. 
- ADD: i18n
    - ko, en, de, in, jp, ru, zhHans, zhHant    
- ADD: Options button
- ADD: Option CC enabled/disabled
    - Subtitles are displayed on shorts videos when YouTube video subtitles option is turned on.

### Questions
- The program does not work
 > If you do not see the automatic switch, you can use it normally by refreshing the tab.

- Can I skip what I don't want to see?
 > It is currently under development, and we plan to add various options such as adding keywords and skipping by adding option buttons.
