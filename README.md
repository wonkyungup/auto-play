<h1>Auto Youtube Shorts Scroll Down</h1>
<p>This extension adds a button to automatically skip YouTube Shorts videos.</p>

A switch is created at the top inside the video.
If there is no switch, it will refresh the page.

It is a test project made for personal study, so I would appreciate it if you could understand it even if you fix it late.
The code has been posted on Github.

If you have any additional or uncomfortable points while using it, please send us a review or e-mail and we will respond.

### Version 1.0.2
- FIX: autoplay intermittent error
- MOD: switch Mui x.

### Questions
- The program does not work
 > If you do not see the automatic switch, you can use it normally by refreshing the tab.

- Can I skip what I don't want to see?
 > It is currently under development, and we plan to add various options such as adding keywords and skipping by adding option buttons.
